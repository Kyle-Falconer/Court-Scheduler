Court-Scheduler
===============

Vision Statement
----------------
Created for Shane Friebe, the Sports Director at The Courts, the Court Scheduler was designed to automate the scheduling process for the staff at The Courts, dramatically cutting the time spent on scheduling basketball leagues.

Setting itself apart from other scheduling programs, the Court Scheduler is designed to allow as many constraints as possible, a feature that is directly beneficial to The Courts where they pride themselves on accommodating for any requests a team may have.

The core feature of the Court Scheduler is that it allows the user to input many different conferences of different ages and skill levels, and receive a master chart with every conference scheduled. Another feature displayed by Group 3 is the "Web Output" feature, which outputs a schedule that is already formatted to be inserted on a webpage.
